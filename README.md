🔍 Insights

Users from Twitter are more intentional, while website sign-ups have higher numbers but lower conversion.

Nigeria has the most sign-ups and verified users.

Ghana has the most activated users and first transactions.

Drop-off after activation suggests friction in onboarding or limited engagement incentives.

💡 Recommendations

Increase targeted ads across all platforms

Improve referral benefits to drive engagement

Reduce activation friction and provide additional platform incentives

Implement country-specific strategies to account for economic/geopolitical factors
