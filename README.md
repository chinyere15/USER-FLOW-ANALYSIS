User Flow Analysis — Finance Platform
Project Description

This project analyzes user behavior on a fictional finance platform, focusing on the user journey from sign-up → email verification → activation → first transaction. The goal is to provide actionable insights on user engagement, conversion rates, and trends over time, showing how many users sign up versus how many actually transact.

Key Objectives

Track total sign-ups and activation metrics

Visualize user progression through the platform

Analyze trends across sign-up channels and countries

Provide an interactive dashboard for decision-making

Dataset

The dataset includes:

User ID

Sign-Up Dates

Email Verified Dates

Activation Date

First Transaction Dates

Country

Sign-Up Channel

Notes: The dataset was cleaned and processed to remove duplicates and blanks, and standardize country names and dates.

Tools & Technologies

Excel: Data cleaning, summary tables, preliminary analysis

SQL: Querying total sign-ups, verified users, activated users, first transactions

Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn): Data validation and additional visualization

Power BI: Interactive dashboard with KPI cards, trend charts, maps, and slicers

Key Metrics

Total Sign-Ups: 500 users

Verified Users: 416 users

Activated Users: 342 users

First Transactions: 246 users

Activation Lag: 3 days on average for first transaction

Drop-Off: Most users drop after activation and do not convert to transactional users

Insights

Users from Twitter are more intentional, while website sign-ups have higher numbers but lower conversion

Nigeria has the most sign-ups and verified users, while Ghana has the most activated users and first transactions

Drop-off after activation suggests friction in onboarding or limited engagement incentives

Recommendations

Increase targeted ads across all platforms

Improve referral benefits to drive engagement

Reduce activation friction and provide additional platform incentives

Implement country-specific strategies to account for economic/geopolitical factors
